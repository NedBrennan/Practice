What is an algorithm
	A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task
		Instagram's Algorithm
		Ad based Algos
		Mathematical functions
	We focus on interview questions

	How do you improve?
		Divise a plan for solving problems
		Master common patterns

Problem Solving

	Understand the problem
	Explore the concrete examples
	break it down
	solve simply
	Refactor
	
Understand the problem
	
	George Polya - How to Solve It
	1. can you restate the problem in your own words?
	2. What are the inputs thsat go into the problem
	3. What are the outputs what will be returned
	4. Do you have enough information
	5. How to label the data

	Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum

Explore concrete examples
	
	Coming up with concrete examples help you test your solution
	User stories - Unit tests

	1. Start with simple examples
	2. Progress with more complex inputs
	3. No input
	4. Invalid input

Break It Down
		
	Explicitly write down steps
		helps catch parts you dont understand
	Writing comments to make notes is important

Solve & Simplify
	
	Ignore what is giving you trouble
		progress to the rest of the problem
		you will gain insight into the more difficult
		part of the problem

Look Back and Refactor
	
	ITS NOT OVER
	Try to improve your code
		How does it read?	
		How efficient is it?

	Checklist
		Can you check the results?
		Can you derive the result differemtly
		Can yo use this solution for something else?
		Can you improve the performance of a solution
			Time/Space complexity
		Does the code follow style guide
		How have others solved this problem

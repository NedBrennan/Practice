Interactions with objects have a complexity

Objects are quick for most things
	they do not have an order
	object methods all have O(n)

Arrays have more nuance
	Arrays have an order
		comes in handy in some cases
		only good if we need order
	Free ordered structure
	constant time when you know the index
		direct shortcut to every index item

	INSERTION
		Adding to the end is O(1)
		Inserting at the beginning O(n)
			must re-index each item
			same goes for removing
